### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an Algorithm Engineer at Ant Group. ðŸ¤” My research interests are mostly in secure computation (which is a subfield of cryptography), and I am currently interested in the theoretical foundations of cryptography, and some of the tools/protocols in cryptography (e.g. PRG, PIR, PSI, FSS).

ðŸ’¬ Check out my personal page at: [https://jamie-cui.github.io/](https://jamie-cui.github.io/)
